### Estimation
## Tasks
1. Movement
            30 mins
    1. Left and Right
        will probably integrate it with Unity Input Manager( Input.GetKeyDown(string)) 
        Was thinking of Rigidbody, because i always prefer that, but would make it hard with faster moving platforms
            15mins
    1. Fall
        Easy with Rigidbody (another variant with Character Controller would be constant force)
            15mins
1. Death Colliders
    1. adding trigger Colliders top and bottom
           15mins
    1. *coding death*
           15mins
1. Platforms
            3hr
    1. randomizing hole position and adjusting left and right cube to it ( wouldve probably cut the hole with boolean shapes if this was Godot :D )
           1hr
    1. Platform Spawning and Despawning (+spawn rate variable)
           1hr

    1. Counter
            15mins
    1. global Tracker
        with my current experience i would do this with a text/.json file, i wouldn't encrypt it for this simple project.
        I have low experience with that
